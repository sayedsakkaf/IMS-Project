# IMS Project - Sayed Sakkaf

In this project, I will create an inventory management system application with customer, item and order features, and the ability to create, read, update and delete using the CRUD functionality.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1) Java Version 11.0 or higher -  Back-End Programming Language
2) Git - Version Control System
3) MySQL Server 5.7+ - Database Management System
4) Maven - Build Tool

```

### Installing

To install the development environment to your system you will first need to fork the repository over to your personal GitHub account. After forking, you will need to use your IDE to clone the repo down to your system. Once the repo has been cloned, you can open the file in your IDE and run Runner.java to begin the application. You will need to create an `ims` file on your local host MySQL to hold the data for the java file. 


### MySQL 'ims' File:

Insert these entries in to your local instance of 'ims' and the Java programme will connect to it and insert data from the console.
