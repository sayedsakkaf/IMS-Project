In this project, I will create an inventory management system application with customer, item and order features, and the ability to create, read, update and delete using the CRUD functionality.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1) Java Version 11.0 or higher -  Back-End Programming Language
2) Git - Version Control System
3) MySQL Server 5.7+ - Database Management System
4) Maven - Build Tool

```
